Drobo Support Firmware for 5D (5 Bay)

You will need the Drobo Software installed to install this custom firmware, provided by Drobo Support.

If you install this firmware it will make the drobo be in read only mode and use the second backup copy MBR. 
I had a MBR corruption on my drobo 5c and this was able to recover the data and allowed me to extract the data.
I then updated the firmware to the latest (4.2.3 [7.199.116068]) and have been using that for a few years now. 

This firmware is only to be used on the 5D model
